// A permission gate is only meaningful when SOMEONE can answer it. In a

// who started it. A workflow run has no conversation and no live user
// attached to the dispatch, so a `prompt` decision there would park a
// promise that literally nobody can resolve — the run would hang until
// the process dies.
//
// `createExtensionPermissionGate` refuses such a gate IMMEDIATELY (no
// promise, no pending entry), recording which capability was refused so
// the caller can raise a precise, human-readable error.
//
// Refusal is decided by THREE independent checks, because key matching
// alone was demonstrably escapable (see the regression suite in
// `workflow-approval-escape.test.ts`):
//
//   1. AsyncLocalStorage — any gate opened anywhere in the dispatch's
//      async subtree, on ANY `conversationId`. This is the check that
//      makes the guarantee unconditional for in-process call chains: a
//      tool that opens a gate against some unrelated conversation id
//      still cannot park a promise the workflow would await.
//   2. The scope-key registry — the id the run passes as
//      `conversationId`. Catches reverse-RPC handlers, which run on the
//      subprocess transport's own async context and therefore do NOT
//      inherit (1).
//   3. The `NON_INTERACTIVE_KEY_PREFIX` id-space invariant. A key minted
//      by `workflowScopeKey()` names no conversation and never will, so
//      NOBODY can ever answer a gate raised against one — whether or not
//      the minting run is still live. This closes the cross-run race
//      where run B rebinds a shared subprocess's reverse-RPC handler and
//      then finishes, leaving run A's nested calls resolving to B's
//      now-deregistered key.
//
// Because a refused gate is never parked, none of the three paths can
// leak a `pendingApprovals` entry.
