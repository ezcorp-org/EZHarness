/**
 * Auto-wire selected bundled extensions into newly-created conversations.
 *
 * Background: `EventSubscriptionDispatcher.dispatch()` gates `run:complete`
 * (and every other `eventSubscription`) delivery on the conversation
 * being wired into the subscriber via the `conversation_extensions`
 * table. Bundled extensions that need to fire on EVERY conversation
 * (not just the ones a user explicitly mentions) need a row inserted
 * at conversation-create time.
 *
 * Phase 53 Stage 2 introduces the lessons-distiller as the first
 * generalised opt-in. The scratchpad already has a hardcoded
 * special-case in `src/runtime/stream-chat/setup-tools.ts`; future
 * bundled extensions can opt in by adding their manifest name to
 * `AUTO_WIRE_BUNDLED_EXTENSION_NAMES`.
 *
 * Failure semantics: this helper NEVER throws. A wiring failure must
 * not block conversation creation — auto-distillation degrades
 * gracefully (silent skip; the legacy host listener was already a
 * fire-and-forget shape) but the conversation itself must persist.
 * Errors are logged and swallowed.
