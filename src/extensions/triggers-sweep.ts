/**
 * Dynamic-trigger lifecycle sweeps (C2).
 *
 * The failure mode this file exists to prevent is an ORPHANED TRIGGER THAT
 * STILL FIRES — a cron row whose job the user deleted, waking a subprocess
 * every Monday forever to run nothing, or worse to run a stale definition.
 *
 * Unregistering is the extension's job (`ctx.triggers.unregister`), but a
 * design that depends on the extension behaving is not a design. So the
 * host runs its own reconciliation on extension start: it tells the
 * extension which keys it holds and asks which are still live.
 *
 * ── The fail-open rule (load-bearing) ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 * If the extension cannot answer — no `ezcorp/triggers-sync` handler
 * (`-32601`), a transport failure, a malformed reply — the sweep disables
 * NOTHING and says so.
 *
 * Reading "no handler" as "the extension claims zero live keys" would wipe
 * every user's triggers on any SDK or extension version skew: ship an
 * extension built against an older SDK, restart, and every job silently
 * stops firing. That is the same silent-kill class as the reconciler hazard
 * this phase already had to fix, just triggered by an upgrade instead of a
 * reconcile. An orphan that keeps firing is a bounded, visible waste; a
 * mass disable is unbounded and invisible.
 *
 * Sweeps are OWNERLESS (no user initiated them), so they audit to
 * `audit_log`, whose `user_id` is nullable — `sdk_capability_calls` has a
 * NOT NULL `on_behalf_of` and structurally cannot record them.
 *
 * ── Who calls this ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * {@link sweepAllDynamicTriggers}, from `HostMaintenanceDaemon`'s hourly
 * tick — the daemon that exists for "host-scoped maintenance sweeps that
 * don't fit the per-extension `ScheduleDaemon` model", which this is.
 *
 * NOT "on extension start", which is how the C2 spec phrased it, and the
 * difference is forced by how extensions actually start. The one extension
 * that holds dynamic triggers today (`ez-factory`) has no `bootSpawn`
 * flag — its subprocess is spawned lazily by a page render, a tool call or
 * a fire — so a boot-time hook would have nothing running to ask. A
 * periodic sweep asks whatever is up at the time and fails open for the
 * rest, which is the same answer a start hook would give, minus the
 * pretence that boot is when it happens.
