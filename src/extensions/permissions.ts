 * their `.ezcorp/extension-data/<name>/` store relative to the project
 * root (`/app`, via `getProjectRoot()` — env → import-meta → git-walk →

 * under the project root but the subprocess's fs grant `$CWD` resolved
 * to `/app/web`, a host-mediated read of the writer's dir landed
 * OUTSIDE the grant → `denyAndDisable` disabled the extension. Anchoring
 * `$CWD` to the project root makes the grant cover exactly where bundled
 * extensions read/write. In production host cwd IS the project root
 * (`/app`), so `getProjectRoot() === process.cwd()` and this is a no-op
 * — the change only widens the dev-only `/app/web` cwd up to `/app`,
 * which can only PERMIT more, never less.
 *
 * `getProjectRoot` is imported STATICALLY: a lazy `require("./bundled")`
 * silently fails under the vite-SSR module transform (it threw, hit the
 * fallback, and the grant stayed at `/app/web` — the original bug
 * persisted). `bundled.ts`'s static import graph does not reach back to

// Even an extension with a covering filesystem grant (`$CWD` widened to
// the project root, or an explicit `/app` / `.ezcorp/data` grant) must
// NOT be able to host-mediated read/write the platform's own DB — which
// also holds the JWT/encryption secret in the `settings` table — or its
// pre-boot snapshots. Landlock is the in-kernel jail, but it is OFF in
// these containers (`EZCORP_PROJECT_ROOT` unset), so the GRANT is the
// only gate; this closes that gap with a software hard-deny in the host
// fs path. Wired BEFORE any allow in both host fs gates (read +
// write), so a reserved path is denied regardless of what the grant —
// or the implicit install-dir allow — would otherwise permit.
//
// Scope is deliberately NARROW: only `.ezcorp/data` (+ the resolved
// `EZCORP_DB_PATH` and its sibling `backups` dir) are reserved. The
// extension store at `.ezcorp/extension-data/<name>/` — where
// file-organizer / task-stack / auto-note legitimately read+write —
// stays fully allowed. Matching is SEGMENT-BOUNDED (`p === reserved ||
// p.startsWith(reserved + "/")`) so a sibling like `.ezcorp/data-export`
// is NOT swept up by `.ezcorp/data`.
