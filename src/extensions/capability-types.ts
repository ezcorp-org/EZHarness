/**
 * Capability discriminated union — single source of truth for the runtime
 * capability shape consumed by the Policy Decision Point
 * (`./permission-engine.ts`).
 *
 * Each `Capability` is a `{kind, value?}` pair. Comparisons go through
 * `intersect` and `isSubset` so capability-comparison logic lives in
 * exactly one place.
 *
 * Per phase-1 spec:
 *   - `network`  — `value` = lowercase hostname
 *   - `fs.*`     — `value` = absolute path
 *   - `shell`    — `value` = undefined (boolean today; per-command-prefix
 *                   allowlists are deferred)
 *   - `env`      — `value` = env var name
 *   - `storage`  — `value` = undefined (boolean)
 *   - `ezcorp:*` — namespaced caps (chat, agent config, spawn, tasks,
 *                   events). `value` is undefined for the boolean variants.
 *
 * Phase 2 will extend `capabilityDeclarationToSet` to substitute runtime
 * values from the tool's actual call args (URL host, fs path, etc.). In
 * Phase 1 it produces caps from the static declaration only; the resolver
 * `_args` parameter is reserved for that future work.

// DELIBERATE OMISSION — `ezcorp:workflows:run` is NOT sensitive.
//
// Three reasons, in decreasing order of weight:
//
//   1. It cannot launder a sensitive capability. A workflow run registers
//      its own non-interactive scope (`beginNonInteractiveScope` in
//      `workflow-executor.ts`), so any `tool` step inside it that needs
//      `shell` / `fs.write` / `ezcorp:extension:install` still hits the PDP
//      and still fails CLOSED — the run terminalizes `awaiting_approval`
//      rather than executing. Triggering a workflow therefore grants
//      strictly nothing the extension could not already reach; it only
//      sequences calls that are each independently gated.
//   2. Consent is already collected, per-name, at install. The grant is
//      `{names, maxRunsPerHour}` clamped to the manifest declaration, so an
//      admin approves a FIXED, reviewable list of workflows the extension
//      itself ships — not an open-ended "run anything" verb. `prompt` adds
//      no information a reviewer didn't already have.
//   3. Always-prompt would make the capability unusable for its only
//      purpose. The `ezcorp/workflows` handler refuses ownerless (cron /
//      webhook) fires outright, and the remaining in-chat path would gain a
//      modal per trigger for a call whose blast radius is already bounded by
//      (1) and (2).
//
// The bound that DOES exist is the per-hour rate limit on the grant, which
// caps LLM spend from `agent` steps. If a future step kind can reach a side
// effect that is NOT independently PDP-gated, revisit this decision first.
//
// ── P2 · C3 CHECKED THE REVISIT CONDITION ABOVE. The answer HELD. ──────
//
// C3 (delegated execution) adds `ezcorp:workflows:run-delegated`, which is
// ALSO deliberately absent from `SENSITIVE_KINDS`. That is a decision, not
// an oversight, and the standing instruction on the line above is what
// obliged this note. Recorded here so a future reader never has to
// re-derive it — and grep-tested, so the check cannot be quietly dropped.
//
// The trigger condition is "a step kind that reaches a side effect that is
// NOT independently PDP-gated". C3 introduces NO step kind at all. A
// delegated run is the same executor over the same step kinds; the only
// thing C3 changes is WHOSE identity the run carries. Reason 1 above is
// therefore untouched: the run still registers its own non-interactive
// scope, so a `tool` step inside it that needs `shell` / `fs.write` /
// `ezcorp:extension:install` still hits the PDP and still fails CLOSED.
//
// Reason 2 (consent collected per-name at install) does NOT survive
// unchanged — a delegated fire reaches a workflow the extension never
// shipped, so no manifest name list can bound it. It is REPLACED, and by
// something narrower on every axis that matters: one workflow rather than
// a list, pinned to a definition version, bound to a capability-set hash,
// revocable, and attached to a named human who consented. The install
// grant contributes only the boolean opt-in
// (`permissions.workflows.allowDelegated`); it authorizes no job by
// itself.
//
// Reason 3 (prompting is structurally impossible) is STRONGER here, not
// weaker: a delegated fire is a background cron/webhook tick by
// construction, so an always-prompt kind would be an unanswerable modal
// with nobody present to answer it.
//
// WHAT WOULD REOPEN THIS: a delegated run that does NOT register the
// non-interactive scope, or any path that lets a delegated run's `tool`
// step skip the PDP. Either one breaks reason 1, and reason 1 is the only
// thing holding this up.
