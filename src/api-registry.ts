  // this with a key holding that scope". These routes gate on
  // `requireSessionAuth` FIRST, so NO key of any scope can reach them at all
  // and `scope: "admin"` would publish a lie about a security boundary. The
  // second gate is `checkRole(locals,"admin")`, which returns its denial
  // rather than throwing it (a thrown Response is a 500, not a 403) — the two
  // together are `requireAdminSession` (src/auth/middleware.ts).

  // The 75 control routes that were on disk and absent from this file,
  // carried as the frozen `KNOWN_UNREGISTERED` debt set in
  // `web/src/__tests__/route-contract.test.ts`. CLAUDE.md makes registration
  // binding for EVERY `/api/*` route; each of these was a standing violation.
  //
  // THE RULE FOLLOWED HERE, and it is the only one that keeps this file
  // useful: `scope` documents what the handler ENFORCES, never what it
  // ought to. `src/openapi.ts:40` renders `scope` as
  // `security: [{ bearerAuth: [scope] }]` — "call this with a key holding
  // that scope" — so a scope declared but not enforced is a false statement
  // about a security boundary in the published contract, and a scope
  // enforced but not declared sends an operator to mint the wrong key.

  // and the description says so in words; the same convention the
