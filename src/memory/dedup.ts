/**
 * Memory dedup helper — host-side, cross-extension by design.
 *
 * Extracted from `src/memory/extraction.ts` in Phase 53.4 Stage 1 so
 * that Stage 2's deletion of `extraction.ts` doesn't break the bundled
 * memory-extractor's dedup path. The decision is locked in
 * tasks/v1.3-phase-53-bundled-extension-ports.md:
 *
 *   > Memory dedup stays host-side. Cross-extension by nature; an
 *   > extension cannot dedup against memories it can't see. Extension
 *   > calls `ctx.memory.write` and the host applies dedup before
 *   > insert. The dedup helper migrates from `src/memory/extraction.ts`
 *   > to a new `src/memory/dedup.ts` host module that survives the
 *   > deletion.
 *
 * Today's wiring (Stage 2 is done — `extraction.ts` is deleted): the
 * single caller is `handleDedupMemoryWrite` in
 * `src/extensions/runtime-invoke-handler.ts`, serving the bundled
 * memory-extractor's `ctx.invoke("runtime.memory.dedupMemoryWrite")`.
 * The extractor uses that RPC rather than `ctx.memory.write` precisely
 * because dedup must see memories authored by any extension, which the
 * `selfOnly` capability surface cannot.
 *
 * The mutex below is a per-project serialization gate. Concurrent
 * `run:complete` events extracting overlapping facts must not race past
 * the similarity check (the `findSimilarMemory` query and the
 * subsequent insert/update are not atomic). It lives here, on the
 * shared helper, so every writer holds ONE lock instance per project —
 * two writers each holding "their own" lock would still race.

//
// Single entry point used by both the legacy extraction listener and
// the bundled memory-extractor's post-write hook. Returns the same
// shape callers expect today: `{action: "inserted" | "updated", id}`.
//
// Behavior:
//   1. Generate / receive an embedding for the candidate content.
//   2. Find the most-similar existing active memory (cross-extension).
//   3. If similarity >= threshold: update the existing row in place
//      (newer wins, history-extended provenance).
//   4. Otherwise: insert a new memory row with full provenance, the
//      source conversation's owner in `user_id`, and the caller's
//      injection eligibility in `injection_eligible`.
//
// The full sequence runs under `withDedupLock(projectKey)` so two
// concurrent run:complete events touching the same project cannot
// both pass the similarity check and produce duplicate rows.
//
// `provenanceFactory` lets the caller stamp extension-specific fields
// (`source`, `extensionId`) without this module knowing about
// extension identity — which keeps the cross-extension dedup
// invariant intact. Eligibility also rides in provenance for audit
// parity, but the COLUMN is what retrieval filters on.
