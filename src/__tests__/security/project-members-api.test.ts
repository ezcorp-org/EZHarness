/**
 * The project-members API — the WRITER that makes `project_members` a
 * membership model rather than an owner column with extra steps.
 *
 * Two things are under test and only one of them is the routes:
 *
 *  1. `checkProjectRole` (`src/auth/middleware.ts`) — the REAL gate. Only
 *     the DB read beneath it is stubbed, so the admin bypass, the
 *     missing-row 403 and the `member` < `owner` ladder are the shipped
 *     implementations, not a copy of them written in this file.
 *  2. The routes' own ordering: scope → project exists → role → body.
 *
 * ## The asymmetry these tests pin, stated once
 *
 * A plain `member` may DELETE THE WHOLE PROJECT (`[id]/+server.ts`) but may
 * NOT add a member. That looks backwards until you name the axis: granting
 * authority is the narrower right, not the more destructive one. A member
 * deleting the project destroys one object they already had full control
 * of; a member who could add members could add a confederate, and that
 * compounds. Both halves are asserted below so the shape cannot be
 * "simplified" into consistency by someone who has not read this.
