// Regression test for two confirmed cross-tenant DELETION holes, plus the
// sibling instances found by sweeping the same shape repo-wide.
//
// ── Bug 1: PUT/DELETE /api/projects/[id] had NO authorization at all ──
//
//   export const DELETE = async ({ params, locals }) => {
//     const scopeErr = requireScope(locals, "read");
//     if (scopeErr) return scopeErr;
//     requireAuth(locals);
//     const deleted = await projectQueries.deleteProject(params.id);   // ← boom
//
// Scope, auth, then straight to the delete. Any authenticated principal
// destroyed (or silently rewrote, via PUT) ANY project by id.
//
// The complication AT THE TIME: `projects` had NO owner column — no
// `userId`, no `createdBy` — and there was no `project_members` table. So
// "check the owner" was not expressible; there was no owner to check. The
// narrowest authorization that WAS expressible was role-based, and PR #82
// shipped it: mutating an instance-global object is an admin action. It
// closed the hole and broke a real case — the non-admin who created a
// project could not rename or delete it.
//
// ── That complication is GONE. `project_members` exists. ──
//
// `src/db/schema.ts` now carries a project ↔ user join table with a role,
// `createProject` stamps its creator as an `owner`, and `migrate()`
// attributes every pre-existing project to the first admin. So these tests
// pin the rule the product actually wanted, not the stop-gap:
//
//   PUT / DELETE /api/projects/[id]  →  any MEMBER of that project,
//                                       or an instance admin.
//
// The admin cases below are unchanged and still pass — the override
// survived — but the "even the member who created it cannot delete it" case
// INVERTED, and that inversion is the whole point of this branch.
//
// Read stays instance-global (GET and the list route are deliberately
// unfiltered and are NOT changed here) — so unlike the sec-H3 routes there
// is no existence secret to protect, and the denial is an honest 403 rather
// than a 404 existence-oracle dodge. Why the read side was not narrowed with
// the write side is recorded in `web/src/routes/api/projects/+server.ts` and
// pinned by the "reads stay instance-global" block at the end of this file:
// after the ownerless backfill, a membership filter on the LIST would show
// every non-admin an empty project list on any upgraded instance.
//
// ── Bug 2: DELETE /api/knowledge-base/[id] failed OPEN on unowned rows ──
//
//   if (file.userId && file.userId !== user.id) return errorJson(404, "…");
//
// The leading `file.userId &&` short-circuits, so a row with `userId IS NULL`
// passed the check for EVERY user — any authenticated caller could delete an
// unowned knowledge-base file. This is the exact sec-H3 shape
// (src/__tests__/security/h3-conversations-memories-idor.test.ts) that a
// prior pass fixed on conversations/memories and missed here. The fix is the
// sec-H3 pattern verbatim, including the deliberate 404-not-403 so the route
// does not become an id-existence oracle:
//
//   if (file.userId !== user.id && user.role !== "admin") return 404;
//
// ── Siblings found by the sweep ──
//
// PUT + DELETE /api/modes/[id] carried the identical fail-open shape on
// `existing.userId`. The separate `existing.builtin` guard does NOT cover it:
// `builtin` and `userId` are independent columns (src/db/schema.ts:1459+),
// and `createMode` writes `builtin: false, userId: data.userId ?? null`
// (src/db/queries/modes.ts:74-75) — so a non-builtin mode with a null userId
// is representable and was editable/deletable by any authenticated user.
//
// POST /api/__test/reset carried the shape too (it deletes a conversation).
// It already had the `&& user.role !== "admin"` clause but kept the leading
// `conv.userId &&` short-circuit, so a null-owner conversation was resettable
// by any caller. Lower severity — the route is fail-closed behind
// `isTestSurfaceEnabled()` and never serves in production — but it is the
// same defect and is fixed with the same one-token change.
//
// Deliberately NOT changed (documented as intentional, evidence in report):
//   - GET /api/agent-configs/[id]:52 — the same shape, but lines 29-33 of
//     that file document null-userId rows as SYSTEM-owned and intentionally
//     world-READABLE; its PUT/DELETE already fail closed correctly.
//   - GET /api/knowledge-base/[id] — read side. The list route
//     (web/src/routes/api/knowledge-base/+server.ts) deliberately shows
//     null-userId files to every user, so tightening GET alone would make a
//     file visible in the list but 404 on fetch. Reported, not changed — and
//     since RULED deliberate: null-owner KB rows are SHARED on both read
//     surfaces, pinned as one invariant by
//     src/__tests__/security/kb-ownerless-rows-are-shared.test.ts.
//   - /api/runs/[id]:30 `if (userId && userId === user.id) return true` — a
//     positive-ALLOW shape, already fail-closed (null grants nothing) and
//     documented at lines 11-35.
//
// Strategy mirrors the sec-H3 test: (A) source-level regression gates that
// flip together with the fix, (B) behavioral probes proving the attack is
// refused AND that the legitimate owner and an admin still succeed.
