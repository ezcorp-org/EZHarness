 * {@link listProjectIdsForUser}, which has no team equivalent: the workflow
 * read/run ladder authorizes a PRINCIPAL against a row without a project id
 * in hand, so it needs the caller's whole membership set, not a point
 * lookup.
 *
 * Nothing here decides authorization. These are the reads the gates in
 * `src/auth/middleware.ts` (`checkProjectRole`) and the ladder in
 * `src/runtime/workflow-scope.ts` are built on; keeping the decision out of
 * the query layer is what stops a second, slightly-different copy of the
 * rule appearing next to the SQL.
