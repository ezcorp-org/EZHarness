/**
 * Atomically deactivate a user and transfer their agents to the acting
 * admin.
 *
 * The pre-fix route did this as an unguarded two-step: a raw
 * `agentConfigs` UPDATE in the handler followed by a separate
 * `updateUserStatus` call. A crash or DB error between the two left the
 * agents silently reassigned while the target user stayed fully ACTIVE.
 * Here both state mutations run inside ONE transaction so they commit
 * together or not at all — no partial state is observable.
 *
 * The `user:deactivated` audit row is written AFTER the transaction
 * commits, on purpose:
 *   - `insertAuditEntry` is the single redaction chokepoint (see
 *     `audit-log.ts`) — the codebase forbids any other direct
 *     audit-table insert call site, so the audit write cannot move inside
 *     the `tx` without going through that wrapper, and the wrapper uses
 *     the top-level connection.
 *   - By contract an audit-write failure MUST NEVER abort (here: roll
 *     back) the business operation. The audit row is a log, not state;
 *     losing it on a crash does not corrupt the invariant the transaction
 *     protects (user status ⇔ agent ownership stay consistent).
 *
 * Works on both drivers (PGlite embedded + Bun.sql external Postgres):
 * drizzle exposes `.transaction()` for each, matching the existing
 * transactional writes in `conversations.ts`.
 *
 * @returns `true` if the target user existed (status was flipped),
 *   `false` otherwise. The audit row is still written on `false` so an
 *   attempted deactivation of a missing user is auditable, mirroring the
 *   pre-fix behaviour.
