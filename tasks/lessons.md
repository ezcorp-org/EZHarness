# Lessons

- Describe a raw entrypoint subprocess as a process, not an installed immutable release.
- In asynchronous delivery tests, await an observed operation or use transport ordering. Do not use a fixed sleep as proof of completion.
- When proving that asynchronous work did not happen, capture and await every operation started by the trigger. Waiting only for the expected positive callback cannot prove the denied phase is complete.
- A denied-path test needs a controlled fault that removes the protection and makes the test fail.
- When screenshot evidence covers navigation removal, assert both the navigation item and the displayed page change. A hidden tab does not prove stale content was removed.
- When invalidation makes an active route unavailable, reuse its existing reload and error path. Automatic fallback navigation adds empty-list and unmount races unless the product requires it.
