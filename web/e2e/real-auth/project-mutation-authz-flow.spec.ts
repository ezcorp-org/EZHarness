/**
 * e2e: PUT/DELETE /api/projects/[id] are gated on PROJECT MEMBERSHIP,
 * end-to-end, with an instance-admin override.
 *
 * ## What this spec used to assert, and why it had to change twice
 *
 * Originally these two handlers ran with NO authorization past
 * `requireAuth` — scope check, auth check, then straight to the write. Any
 * authenticated principal could destroy any project by id, or silently
 * repoint its `path` (which drives filesystem scoping for that project).
 *
 * PR #82 closed that with the only rule then expressible: `role === "admin"`.
 * `projects` had no owner column and there was no `project_members` table, so
 * "let the person who made it rename it" could not be written. The cost was
 * real and known — a non-admin could no longer rename or delete the project
 * they had just created.
 *
 * `project_members` now exists, so the rule is membership: any MEMBER of the
 * project (plus any instance admin) may mutate it; a non-member may not.
 *
 * ## The second correction: this spec had stopped testing what it claimed
 *
 * The previous version minted its member-role key with `scopes: ["read"]` and
 * said, in a comment, that the key "clears the scope gate and is stopped only
 * by the role gate". That was true when it was written and became FALSE when
 * the `write` scope landed (PR #80/#85) and these handlers moved onto it: the
 * key no longer held the scope the handlers ask for, so its 403s came from
 * `requireScope`, and the authorization axis the spec exists for was not
 * being exercised at all. A spec that asserts the right status for the wrong
 * reason is indistinguishable from a passing one.
 *
 * The key below therefore holds `write` — the exact scope PUT and DELETE
 * demand — so every 403 here is provably the MEMBERSHIP gate.
 *
 * ## Why the member-role key is the interesting principal
 *
 * It carries `role: "member"` (bearer-auth clamps every key to member) while
 * its `userId` is the admin who minted it. So it is the one principal that
 * can show membership and role are separate axes: it is refused when its
 * owner is not a member, and admitted when its owner is — never because of
 * the role, which never changes.
 *
 * Raw `fetch` is used for the key's calls so the bootstrapped admin's session
 * cookie is provably absent — the only authority is the key.
 *
 * Not covered here: the null-`userId` knowledge-base branch of the original
 * change. `POST /api/knowledge-base` always stamps `userId`, so an unowned
 * row is not reachable over HTTP and that branch is pinned at handler level
 * in src/__tests__/security/cross-tenant-deletion-projects-kb-modes.test.ts.
