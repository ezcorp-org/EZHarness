/**
 * The WRITER for `project_members` — the thing that makes the table a
 * membership model rather than an owner column with extra steps.
 *
 * Without this route a project has exactly one member forever (its creator,
 * stamped by `createProject`), the `member` role has no producer at all, and
 * the read/run audience `project-members-and-admins` in
 * `src/runtime/workflow-scope.ts` admits a set nobody can join. A rung of a
 * ladder that no code path can put a principal on is the exact defect that
 * module's header calls out about `visibility: "private"`.
 *
 * ## Who may do what
 *
 * | verb   | gate            | why |
 * |--------|-----------------|-----|
 * | GET    | `member`        | knowing who else is on a project you are on |
 * | POST   | **`owner`**     | granting authority is the narrower right |
 *
 * `checkProjectRole` lets instance admins bypass, so an admin can always
 * repair a project's membership — including one whose only owner was
 * deleted (their rows CASCADE away).
 *
 * The 404-before-403 ordering matters: a caller who is not a member must not
 * be able to tell a real project id from a fabricated one through the
 * SHAPE of the refusal... except that they already can, because `GET
 * /api/projects` is instance-global and unfiltered. So the ordering here is
 * the honest one instead: the project's existence is checked FIRST and a
 * missing project is a plain 404, because pretending otherwise would protect
 * nothing the list route does not already publish.
