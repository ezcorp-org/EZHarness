/**
 * Remove a member from a project. `owner` (or an instance admin) only —
 * same rule as adding one, for the same reason: membership is the authority
 * axis, and a plain `member` who could revoke an owner would be able to take
 * a project over.
 *
 * ## The LAST member cannot be removed
 *
 * A project with zero membership rows is reachable only through the
 * instance-admin override. `migrate()`'s ownerless backfill exists precisely
 * to stop that state existing, so the API must not be able to re-create it
 * one DELETE at a time — an owner removing themselves from their own project
 * would silently hand it to the admins and lock every member out.
 *
 * The refusal is a 409, not a 403: the caller HAS the authority, the request
 * is refused because of the state it would leave behind. A 403 would read as
 * "you may not do this", which is the wrong diagnosis and sends the operator
 * looking at roles instead of at the member count.
