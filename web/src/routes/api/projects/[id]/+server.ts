/**
 * Authorization model for projects: PROJECT MEMBERSHIP, with an instance
 * -admin override.
 *
 * This route used to gate PUT/DELETE on `user.role === "admin"`, and said so
 * at length, because there was nothing else to gate on: `projects` had no
 * owner column and no `project_members` table, so "let the person who made
 * it rename it" was not expressible. PR #82 shipped that stop-gap knowing it
 * broke a real case — the non-admin who created a project could not rename
 * or delete it from `/project/[id]/settings`.
 *
 * `project_members` (`src/db/schema.ts`) is now that model, so the rule is
 * the one the product actually wanted:
 *
 *   | caller                      | GET | PUT / DELETE |
 *   |-----------------------------|-----|--------------|
 *   | instance admin              | yes | yes          |
 *   | project member (any role)   | yes | yes          |
 *   | authenticated non-member    | yes | **no**       |
 *
 * `createProject` stamps its creator as an `owner`, so the case #82 broke —
 * a member renaming the project they just made — is the FIRST case this
 * covers rather than an afterthought.
 *
 * READS ARE DELIBERATELY NOT NARROWED, and the asymmetry in that table is
 * the point rather than an oversight. `GET /api/projects` returns every
 * project to every authenticated caller, so hiding a single project behind a
 * 404 here would be theatre — the same caller finds it in the list one
 * request later. Filtering the list is a separate, wider change: after the
 * migration's ownerless backfill every pre-existing project is owned by the
 * first admin, so a read filter would show a non-admin an EMPTY project list
 * on any instance that predates this table. That is a data-migration
 * question, not an authorization one, and it is tracked as the open gap it
 * is (pinned by "reads stay instance-global" in
 * `src/__tests__/security/cross-tenant-deletion-projects-kb-modes.test.ts`).
 *
 * 403, not the 404 used by the sec-H3 routes: those collapse denial into
 * "not found" to avoid an id-existence oracle. Projects have no existence to
 * hide — see above — so a 404 would misreport a project that plainly exists
 * and that this same caller may read.
 *
 * The gate itself is `checkProjectRole` in `src/auth/middleware.ts`, next to
 * `requireTeamRole`, so the membership read lives with the other membership
 * read rather than in a route.
