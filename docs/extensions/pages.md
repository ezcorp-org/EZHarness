# Hub Pages

Extensions can contribute **page-level UI**: a tab on the top-level **Hub** page (`/hub`), rendered from a declarative JSON component tree. Your code sends *data*; the host renders native Svelte. Extension HTML/JS never touches the DOM — XSS is impossible by construction.

Core features use the same system (the Daily Briefing tab at `/hub/core:briefing` is a core provider), so your page gets the exact same renderer, validation, and caching as first-party UI.

**Worked reference:** [`examples/cron-dashboard/`](examples/cron-dashboard/) — a dashboard that self-tracks its scheduled runs, with stats, a run table, a confirm-gated "Clear log" action, and live `pushPage` refresh.

---

## 1. Declare the page in your manifest

```typescript
// ezcorp.config.ts
pages: [
  {
    id: "dashboard",            // /^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]{0,31}$/, unique within the extension
    title: "Cron Dashboard",    // tab label, ≤ 50 chars
    icon: "Clock",              // optional lucide name (unknown → fallback icon)
    description: "Scheduled-run history.", // optional, ≤ 200 chars
  },
],
permissions: {
  // Page ACTIONS reuse the eventSubscriptions allowlist — any action
  // node naming an event NOT listed here is silently dropped by the
  // host's tree validator.
  eventSubscriptions: ["cron-dashboard:clear-log"],
},
```

- Max **3 pages** per extension (`validatePagesArray`, enforced at install).
- **Declaring a page IS the grant** — there is no separate permission key. The page is listed on the extension detail UI like other components; enabling the extension enables the tab.
- The tab appears at `/hub/ext:<extension-name>:<page-id>` once the extension is enabled.

## 2. Serve renders with `definePage`

```typescript
import { definePage, PageBuilder, getChannel } from "@ezcorp/sdk/runtime";

definePage({
  id: "dashboard",
  render: async () =>
    new PageBuilder("Cron Dashboard")
      .stats([{ label: "Tracked runs", value: "12" }])
      .table(["Fired at", "Cron"], [{ cells: ["2026-06-12 07:05", "*/5 * * * *"] }])
      .button("Clear log", {
        event: "cron-dashboard:clear-log",
        confirm: "Clear the entire run log?",
      }, "danger"),
  actions: {
    // Keyed by the FULL namespaced event name.
    "cron-dashboard:clear-log": async ({ userId, pageId, payload }) => {
      // ...mutate state, then push a fresh tree (step 4).
    },
  },
});

getChannel().start();
```

- The host pulls renders over the existing JSON-RPC channel (`ezcorp/page.render`, dispatched on `pageId`). First open lazy-spawns your subprocess (~1–3s; the Hub shows a skeleton). Renders are raced against a **10s** timeout.
- Render results are cached host-side (~60s TTL). Stale entries are served instantly with a background refresh.
- `render` may return a `PageBuilder` (built automatically) or a raw `{ title, nodes }` tree.

## 3. Component vocabulary

`PageBuilder` inherits the full **panel** vocabulary (`title`, `markdown` → text, `list`, `badge`, `counter`, `kv`, `progress`, `status`, `divider` — wire shapes identical to the bottom panel) and adds page-only nodes:

| Node | Builder method | Fields | Notes |
|------|----------------|--------|-------|
| `section` | `.section(title?, b => …)` | nested `nodes` | The ONLY nesting node. Depth ≤ 6. |
| `heading` | `.heading(level, text)` | `level` 1–3, `text` | |
| `markdown` | `.markdownBlock(content)` | `content` ≤ 10k chars | Rendered through the host's DOMPurify pipeline. |
| `stats` | `.stats(items)` | `[{label, value, hint?}]` ≤ 12 | Stat-card grid. |
| `table` | `.table(columns, rows)` | columns ≤ 12, rows ≤ 100; row `action?`/`href?` | `href` rows deep-link; `action` rows dispatch on click. |
| `button` | `.button(label, action, style?)` | `style`: `primary`/`secondary`/`danger` | |
| `link` | `.link(label, href)` | internal `href` only | |
| `empty-state` | `.emptyState(title, detail?)` | | |

## 4. Push live updates with `pushPage`

```typescript
import { pushPage } from "@ezcorp/sdk/runtime";

pushPage("dashboard", new PageBuilder("Cron Dashboard")./* … */);
```

The host validates the tree, caches it, and broadcasts a **content-free invalidation signal** (`ext:page-state` — only `{extensionId, extensionName, pageId}`, never tree content). Open Hub tabs re-pull the session-authed render endpoint. Pushes share the panel's mediator budget: **10 updates/second** per extension, 64KB per tree.

## 4b. Per-project pages (`perProject: true`)

One flag turns a page into a **project-aware** surface — the same page id renders differently depending on where it's viewed:

```typescript
// ezcorp.config.ts
pages: [{ id: "dashboard", title: "My Dashboard", perProject: true }],
```

```typescript
definePage({
  id: "dashboard",
  render: async (ctx) => {
    if (ctx?.project) return buildProjectView(ctx.project);   // /project/<id>/hub/...
    if (ctx?.projects) return buildHomeView(ctx.projects);    // /hub/... (all projects)
    return buildFallbackView();                               // host without perProject support
  },
});
```

- **Project hub** (`/project/<id>/hub/ext:<name>:<page>`): `render` receives `{ project: { id, name, path } }` — render that project's view. `path` is the project's checkout root, so data keyed by repo/path maps directly.
- **Global hub** (`/hub/ext:<name>:<page>`): `render` receives `{ projects }` — the full project list, for an overview/home view. Deep-link rows into the project hub with `href: `/project/${p.id}/hub/${encodeURIComponent("ext:<name>:<page>")}``.
- **Compatibility**: without the flag (or on an older host) `render` is called with no context — a zero-arg `render` keeps working unchanged. The flag is additive; nothing else about actions, limits, or validation changes.
- **Caching**: variants are cached per (extension, page, project) with the same ~60s TTL. Concurrent re-pulls of one variant are single-flighted host-side, so an invalidation with many open viewers costs ONE render, not one per tab.
- **Refresh**: use `invalidatePage("dashboard")` — it drops every cached variant and broadcasts the content-free signal, so each open view (home or any project) re-pulls its own context. On a `perProject` page a `pushPage` tree is ENFORCED as invalidate-only (the tree is discarded): a tree built in one context can't cover the global + per-project variants, so the host never caches it as the home view:

```typescript
import { invalidatePage } from "@ezcorp/sdk/runtime";

invalidatePage("dashboard"); // all variants re-pull with their own context
```

## 5. Action contract

Buttons and table rows carry `{ event, payload?, confirm?, prompt? }`:

- `event` must be `<your-extension-name>:<event>` AND listed in `permissions.eventSubscriptions` — double-gated: the tree validator drops undeclared action nodes at render time, and the events route 404s undeclared events at POST time.
- The Hub POSTs to `/api/extensions/<name>/events/<event>` with body `{ source: "hub", pageId, payload? }` (payload ≤ 2KB). Rate limit: 10 actions/min/user.
- Your subprocess receives the standard `ezcorp/event/<name>:<event>` notification with `{ source: "hub", pageId, userId, payload? }` — `definePage`'s `actions` map handles it (same wire format as `registerEventHandler`).
- `confirm` strings are rendered by the HOST in a native confirm dialog before dispatch.
- `payload` carries small structured values for the action. Free-form **text** input is collected through a `prompt` (below) — there are still no inline input/form nodes.
- **`payload` is attacker-controlled.** The host caps its size and shape, but any authenticated user can POST any payload to your declared events directly — never trust field values. Validate every field in your handler before acting on it (treat it exactly like untrusted HTTP input).

### `prompt` — collect one text value before dispatch

An action may attach an optional `prompt` so the **host** opens a single-field text dialog before dispatching:

```ts
page.button("Rename", {
  event: "cron-dashboard:rename",
  prompt: { label: "New name", placeholder: "Nightly", field: "name", maxLength: 80 },
});
```

`PagePrompt` = `{ label, placeholder?, field?, maxLength?, submitLabel?, format? }`. On Submit the host merges the typed string into `payload[field]` (default `"value"`) and dispatches the action through its **unchanged, already-gated** event path. Enter submits; Esc/Cancel closes with no POST; Submit is disabled while the trimmed value is empty.

An optional `format` opts the dialog into a **shared host widget** instead of the plain text box — e.g. `format: "file-path"` reuses the app's filesystem picker (autocomplete + browse), so a folder-path prompt feels the same as the file picker elsewhere in EZCorp:

```ts
page.button("Add watched folder", {
  event: "file-organizer:add-folder",
  prompt: { label: "Folder path", placeholder: "/watched/Downloads", field: "path", format: "file-path" },
});
```

Allowed formats are the scalar-string producers in the host's `PROMPT_FORMATS` (`file-path`, `combo-box`, `search`, `date`, `datetime`). An unknown/excluded value is dropped host-side and the dialog falls back to the plain text input — the typed result is still merged into `payload[field]` exactly as a text prompt would be. When `format` is set the widget owns its own keyboard handling, so the host doesn't bind Enter-to-submit; the user clicks Submit.

**`prompt` grants your extension ZERO new authority** — it is only a host-mediated way for the *user* to type a string into an action you **already** declared and that is **already** gated:

- The input widget is **100% host-rendered**. You supply only display strings (`label`/`placeholder`/`submitLabel`) — never DOM, never HTML, never a URL. The host `<>`-strips + truncates them; a malformed prompt is silently dropped and the action degrades to a plain dispatch (it is never fatal).
- **No new dispatch path.** A prompt action still routes through the same `eventSubscriptions` allowlist + page-declared check + 10/min/user limiter + 2KB payload cap. You cannot conjure a new event via `prompt`.
- **The typed value is untrusted and stays a scalar.** It is merged into `payload[field]` as a single string. `field` is slug-sanitized (`/^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9_]{0,31}$/`, default `"value"`) so it cannot spoof a reserved payload key. Validate it in your handler like any other untrusted input.
- **Echo-back is re-sanitized.** If your handler echoes the value into a re-rendered tree, that tree passes back through `validatePageTree` — every display string is `<>`-stripped, so a `<script>`-laden value can never reach the DOM.
- `maxLength` is an author hint only; the host clamps it to `[1, 500]` (default 200) and re-validates server-side regardless.

## 6. Limits & security rules (server-enforced)

- Tree ≤ **64KB**, ≤ **500 nodes**, depth ≤ **6**, tables ≤ **100×12**, action payloads ≤ **2KB**; per-string truncation everywhere.
- Every tree — pulled, pushed, or core-provided — passes the same `validatePageTree` before it is cached or served. Invalid nodes are dropped (forward-compat); invalid envelopes produce an error card with retry.
- `href` values must be **relative internal paths** (start with a single `/`; `//`, `\`, and absolute URLs are rejected server-side AND re-checked client-side).
- The only HTML-capable node is `markdown`, sanitized by the host's shared DOMPurify config. Styles are enum variants only — no class/style passthrough.
- Icons resolve through the host's lucide allowlist with a safe fallback.
- Renders are per-session (12/min/user/page); the SSE invalidation signal never carries content, so nothing leaks cross-user.
- **Page trees are SHARED across all users.** Renders and `pushPage` trees are cached per (extension, page) — not per user — and served to every signed-in user. Never `pushPage` (or render) user-specific data into the tree. Per-user data belongs in ACTION responses, keyed by the host-stamped `userId` your handler receives (the host stamps it; clients cannot spoof it).
